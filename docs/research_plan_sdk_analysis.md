# HyperEVM/Hyperliquid SDK Competition Analysis - Research Plan

## Objective
Analyze existing HyperEVM/Hyperliquid SDKs to identify gaps, limitations, and competitive opportunities for our SDK development.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Core SDK Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Research nktkas/hyperliquid TypeScript SDK
  - [x] Repository analysis and documentation review
  - [x] Feature set identification
  - [x] Code structure and API design review
  - [x] Limitations and issues identification
  - [x] Community feedback analysis
- [x] 1.2 Analyze HyperEVM VRF SDK scope
  - [x] VRF functionality research - No specific HyperEVM VRF SDK found
  - [x] SDK capabilities and limitations - General VRF concepts identified
  - [x] Implementation approach analysis - No HyperEVM-specific VRF identified
- [x] 1.3 Review Swift SDK capabilities
  - [x] Swift SDK feature set - No native Swift SDK found
  - [x] Platform-specific advantages/limitations - OneShot app exists but no SDK
  - [x] Integration capabilities - Mobile app available, no developer SDK
- [x] 1.4 Study OpenAPI Schema approach
  - [x] Schema-based SDK generation - No OpenAPI specification found
  - [x] Benefits and limitations - General OpenAPI tools identified
  - [x] Developer experience analysis - Manual API integration required

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Transaction simulation feature gaps
  - [x] Current simulation capabilities across SDKs - Limited to basic order simulation
  - [x] Missing functionality identification - No transaction preview/simulation like EVM chains
  - [x] Performance benchmarking gaps - No gas estimation equivalent for non-EVM
- [x] 2.2 Developer experience gaps
  - [x] Documentation quality assessment - Manual integration required
  - [x] Ease of integration analysis - No unified SDK approach
  - [x] Error handling and debugging support - Limited cross-language consistency
- [x] 2.3 Platform coverage gaps
  - [x] Supported platforms and languages - Missing Swift, limited mobile support
  - [x] Missing ecosystem integrations - No OpenAPI, limited mobile SDKs

### Phase 3: Competitive Advantage Identification
- [x] 3.1 Technical advantages
  - [x] Performance optimization opportunities - L1 blockchain simulation capabilities
  - [x] Feature completeness gaps - Transaction preview/simulation missing
  - [x] Innovation opportunities - Order book simulation, market impact prediction
- [x] 3.2 Developer experience advantages
  - [x] Better documentation approaches - Unified API documentation with OpenAPI
  - [x] Improved API design patterns - Type-safe SDKs across all languages
  - [x] Enhanced tooling integration - IDE integration, debugging tools
- [x] 3.3 Market positioning opportunities
  - [x] Underserved market segments - Mobile developers, Swift ecosystem
  - [x] Unique value propositions - L1-native simulation, order book modeling

### Phase 4: Report Generation
- [x] 4.1 Compile comprehensive analysis
- [x] 4.2 Structure findings with competitive insights
- [x] 4.3 Generate actionable recommendations
- [x] 4.4 Save to `docs/sdk_competition_analysis.md`

## Success Criteria
- Complete analysis of all specified SDKs
- Clear identification of gaps and limitations
- Documented competitive advantages
- Actionable recommendations for SDK development
