# Research Plan: Stainless-Style SDK Generation and Modern SDK Architecture Patterns

## Task Overview
Research Stainless API's approach to SDK generation and analyze modern SDK architecture patterns, focusing on type safety, multi-language consistency, and code generation best practices.

## Research Objectives
1. **Stainless API Analysis** - Understanding their approach to generating idiomatic, type-safe SDKs
2. **Multi-language Consistency** - Best practices for maintaining consistency across different programming languages
3. **OpenAPI/JSON Schema Integration** - How schema-driven generation works in practice
4. **Type Safety & Error Handling** - Cross-language approaches to type safety and robust error handling
5. **Modern SDK Architecture** - Client patterns, async support, streaming, retries, and other modern patterns
6. **Code Generation Tools** - Analysis of tools, templates, and methodologies

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Baseline Research and Information Gathering
- [x] 1.1 Research Stainless API company and their SDK generation approach
- [x] 1.2 Search for technical documentation, blog posts, and case studies about Stainless
- [x] 1.3 Investigate OpenAPI/JSON Schema driven SDK generation patterns
- [x] 1.4 Research modern SDK architecture patterns and best practices
- [x] 1.5 Identify code generation tools and frameworks in the space

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis and Technical Investigation
- [x] 2.1 Analyze Stainless-generated SDK examples across different languages
- [x] 2.2 Study type safety implementations in popular SDKs
- [x] 2.3 Examine error handling patterns across languages
- [x] 2.4 Investigate async patterns, streaming, and retry mechanisms
- [x] 2.5 Research client architecture patterns and design principles

### Phase 3: Synthesis and Implementation Research
- [x] 3.1 Compare different SDK generation approaches
- [x] 3.2 Identify best practices for multi-language consistency
- [x] 3.3 Document modern SDK architecture patterns with code examples
- [x] 3.4 Research specific implementation recommendations
- [x] 3.5 Compile code generation tools and template strategies

### Phase 4: Report Generation
- [x] 4.1 Create comprehensive analysis document
- [x] 4.2 Include specific implementation recommendations
- [x] 4.3 Provide code examples for key patterns
- [x] 4.4 Document findings with proper citations

## Target Deliverable
Detailed analysis saved to `research/stainless_architecture_analysis.md` with:
- Comprehensive overview of Stainless API's approach
