# HyperCore and HyperEVM Integration Research Plan

## Research Objectives
Comprehensive research on HyperCore system and its integration with HyperEVM covering:
1. What is HyperCore and its purpose
2. How HyperCore data syncs with HyperEVM
3. Cross-layer communication mechanisms
4. APIs and data access methods
5. Integration patterns for developers
6. Data structures and formats used

## Task Type: Verification-Focused Task
**Focus**: Deep verification and analysis of technical integration patterns and mechanisms

## Research Steps
