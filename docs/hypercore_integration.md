# HyperCore and HyperEVM Integration: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

HyperCore and HyperEVM represent a revolutionary dual-layer blockchain architecture that addresses fundamental challenges in distributed systems, particularly data consistency and cross-layer communication in decentralized finance. HyperCore serves as a high-performance Rust-based execution environment optimized for trading operations, while HyperEVM provides EVM-compatible smart contract capabilities. Their integration through unified state design, precompiled contracts, and the CoreWriter mechanism eliminates traditional cross-chain complexity while enabling real-time financial applications with unprecedented performance and composability.

## 1. Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive technical analysis of HyperCore and HyperEVM integration within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The research examines the architectural design, synchronization mechanisms, communication protocols, APIs, integration patterns, and data structures that enable seamless interaction between these two execution layers. The analysis is based on official documentation, technical specifications, and verified integration examples from the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

## 2. HyperCore: Architecture and Purpose

### 2.1 System Architecture

HyperCore represents Hyperliquid's foundational layerâ€”a purpose-built Rust runtime optimized for high-frequency trading systems where microsecond optimizations matter[2]. Operating as a permissioned Layer-1 blockchain, HyperCore provides complete control over block space and houses Hyperliquid's native components including perpetual and spot order books[5].

### 2.2 Performance Specifications

HyperCore delivers exceptional performance metrics through its HyperBFT consensus mechanism[3]:

- **Throughput**: Supports 200,000+ orders per second with design capacity for 1,000,000+ orders per second
- **Latency**: Median latency of 0.1 seconds, P99 latency of 0.5 seconds
- **Finality**: Block finalization under one second (600x faster than Bitcoin's 60-minute finality)
- **Daily Volume**: Capable of handling up to $30 billion in daily trading volume

### 2.3 Core Functionality

HyperCore handles all critical trading operations[1,4]:
- Native perpetual and spot order book management
- High-performance trade execution and settlement
- Staking mechanisms and native multisig support
- Core exchange functionality with built-in MEV protections at the consensus layer
- Reduced trading fees for HYPE token stakers

The system operates under Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus, maintaining security by handling up to one-third of validators being malicious actors, matching the security guarantees of major blockchains while delivering superior performance[3].

## 3. Data Synchronization Between HyperCore and HyperEVM

### 3.1 Unified State Architecture

The cornerstone of HyperCore-HyperEVM integration is the unified state architecture that eliminates traditional cross-chain complexity[3]. Unlike conventional multi-chain designs where separate blockchains maintain independent states, HyperEVM operates within the same HyperBFT consensus layer that secures HyperCore, creating a single, consistent state across both execution environments.

### 3.2 Synchronized Data Sharing

Data synchronization operates through direct state sharing rather than message passing[3]:

- **Real-time Updates**: When HyperCore updates market data (e.g., Bitcoin price changes to $50,100), HyperEVM instantly accesses the same data without requiring queries or waiting for confirmation
- **Guaranteed Consistency**: Both layers maintain identical data simultaneously, eliminating lag-induced discrepancies that plague traditional cross-chain architectures
- **Atomic State Changes**: Updates to the unified state are atomic, ensuring both layers always reflect the same information at any given block height

### 3.3 Sequential Block Execution

The synchronization mechanism leverages sequential block execution where blocks are processed in order, allowing[8]:
- HyperEVM to read L1 state from the previous block, ensuring up-to-date information
- HyperEVM to write actions that will be executed in the next L1 block
- Guaranteed data freshness for financial applications requiring real-time accuracy

## 4. Cross-Layer Communication Mechanisms

### 4.1 Read Precompiles: Direct System Access

HyperCore-HyperEVM communication primarily occurs through read precompiles, which replace traditional message-passing systems[3]. These precompiles function as built-in system functions providing smart contracts with direct "system call" access to trading data.

**Technical Implementation:**[8]
- Precompiled contracts at well-known addresses (e.g., `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800`)
- Smart contracts use `staticcall` to read L1 state directly
- Values are guaranteed to match the latest HyperCore state at EVM block construction time

**Example Solidity Implementation:**[8]
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract PositionReader {
    address constant PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800;
    
    struct Position {
        int64 szi;
        uint32 leverage;
        uint64 entryNtl;
    }
    
    function readPosition(address user, uint16 perp) external view returns (Position memory) {
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS.staticcall(abi.encode(user, perp));
        require(success, "readPosition call failed");
        return abi.decode(result, (Position));
    }
}
```

### 4.2 CoreWriter: Write Operations to HyperCore

The CoreWriter mechanism enables HyperEVM applications to write directly to HyperCore, eliminating trusted intermediaries[5]. Deployed at the fixed address `0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333`, CoreWriter serves as the essential connector for bidirectional interaction.

**Key Characteristics:**[7]
- Writes to the first produced HyperCore block after EVM block production
- Enables smart contracts to execute native operations (staking, trading, liquidity provision) as first-class operations
- Maintained by the Hyperliquid core team and safe for production use

### 4.3 Event-Based L1 Actions

Actions on HyperCore are triggered through events emitted from the system address `0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333`[8]:

**Example L1 Order Submission:**[8]
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract L1Write {
    event IocOrder(address indexed user, uint16 perp, bool isBuy, uint64 limitPx, uint64 sz);
    
    function sendIocOrder(uint16 perp, bool isBuy, uint64 limitPx, uint64 sz) external {
        emit IocOrder(msg.sender, perp, isBuy, limitPx, sz);
    }
}
```

### 4.4 Unified Token Management

Token transfers between layers utilize a unified balance sheet approach rather than traditional bridging[3]:
- No tokens are "sent" between layers; instead, the master balance sheet is updated
- Both HyperCore and HyperEVM read from the same underlying balance records
- Eliminates bridge vulnerabilities while ensuring atomic transfers
- Token management system uses specific address formatting with first byte `0x20` and token index encoded in big-endian format

## 5. APIs and Data Access Methods

### 5.1 JSON-RPC Interface

HyperEVM facilitates interaction exclusively through JSON-RPC protocol[1]:
- **Primary Endpoint**: `rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm`
- **Environment Support**: Both Mainnet and Testnet
- **WebSocket Limitation**: No websocket JSON-RPC support for primary RPC endpoint
- **Application Compatibility**: No official frontend components; developers must build custom frontends or port existing EVM applications

### 5.2 System Contracts for L1 Data Access

System contracts provide API-like access to Layer 1 blockchain data[4]:

**Key System Contract Addresses:**[7]
- **HYPE Token**: `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`
- **CoreWriter**: `0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333`
- **Asset Bridge Precompile**: `0x200000000000000000000000000000000000abcd` (where 'abcd' is the coreIndexId in hexadecimal)

**Functionality:**[4]
- Direct access to market data and transaction history
- Real-time blockchain information integration
- Support for both read and write operations to L1 state

### 5.3 Dual-Block Architecture API Design

The dual-block architecture optimizes API performance for different transaction types[2,3]:

**Fast Blocks:**
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Gas Limit: 2M
- Purpose: Regular trades and time-sensitive transactions
- Optimal for lightweight operations

**Slow Blocks:**
- Duration: 1 minute
- Gas Limit: 30M
- Purpose: Complex smart contract deployments and data-intensive operations
- Suitable for batch operations and large deployments

**Mempool Implementation:**[6]
- Onchain state relative to umbrella L1 execution
- Split into two independent mempools for each block type
- Accepts only next 8 nonces per address
- Automatic pruning of transactions older than 1 day

## 6. Integration Patterns for Developers

### 6.1 Builder Codes Integration

Builder Codes provide a unique revenue-sharing integration pattern[5]:
- **Mechanism**: Developers receive unique identifiers to connect frontends to Hyperliquid's backend
- **Revenue Model**: Automatic percentage of trading fees paid to developers for trades executed through their Builder Code
- **Customization**: Full fee customization capabilities
- **Vision**: Part of Hyperliquid's "AWS of liquidity" strategy

### 6.2 HIP-3 Permissionless Market Creation

HIP-3 enables developers to create custom markets through a structured auction system[5]:
- **Deployment Mechanism**: Dutch auction system running every 31 hours
- **Security Requirements**: 1 million HYPE tokens staking as collateral
- **Control Parameters**: Oracle selection, margin requirements, funding mechanisms
- **Revenue Sharing**: Market creators earn up to 50% of trading fees
- **Market Types**: Supports equities, commodities, FX, prediction markets

### 6.3 Liquid Staking Token (LST) Integration

LST protocols leverage CoreWriter for sophisticated staking strategies[5]:

**Example Implementations:**
- **Kinetiq**: Pioneers trustless cross-layer operations via CoreWriter precompiles, offering kHYPE, iHYPE, and vkHYPE products (78% market share, $1.28 billion TVL)
- **StakedHYPE**: Retail-accessible with instant unstaking and seamless rebase mechanics (11% market share, $181 million TVL)
- **Hyperbeat**: CoreWriter and HIP-3 powered LST in collaboration with Ether.fi (7% market share, $114 million TVL)

### 6.4 Cross-Chain Integration Patterns

**HyperUnit Tokenization:**[5]
- Distributed network of three Guardians using Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
- Private key splitting ensures no single entity control
- Enables trading real Bitcoin and Ethereum directly on Hyperliquid
- Eliminates reliance on wrapped tokens or external bridges

**Oracle Architecture Integration:**[5]
- **Native HyperCore Oracle**: Price feeds embedded in validator infrastructure
- **Builder-Deployed Oracles**: For HIP-3 markets with flexible oracle selection
- **HyperEVM DeFi Oracles**: Standard EVM oracle integrations with CoreWriter synergies

## 7. Data Structures and Formats

### 7.1 CoreWriter Action Encoding

CoreWriter interactions utilize specific encoding patterns[6,7]:

**Action Encoding Structure:**
- **Header**: 4-byte action ID (e.g., `0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x07` for `sendUsdClassTransfer`)
- **Payload Structure**: `[version][actionId][actionBytes]`
- **Example Encoding**: `abi.encodePacked(abi.encodePacked(hex"1600", action))`

**Implementation Pattern:**[6]
```solidity
function sendUsdClassTransfer(uint64 ntl, bool toPerp) external {
    bytes memory encodedAction = abi.encode(ntl, toPerp);
    bytes memory data = new bytes(4 + encodedAction.length);
    
    // Set header bytes
    data[0] = 0x01;
    data[1] = 0x00;
    data[2] = 0x00;
    data[3] = 0x07;
    
    // Append encoded action
    for (uint i = 0; i < encodedAction.length; i++) {
        data[4 + i] = encodedAction[i];
    }
    
    CoreWriter(0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333).sendRawAction(data);
}
```

### 7.2 Position Data Structures

Trading positions utilize structured data formats for cross-layer access[8]:

```solidity
struct Position {
    int64 szi;        // Size of position
    uint32 leverage;  // Leverage multiplier
    uint64 entryNtl;  // Entry notional value
}
```

### 7.3 Token Management Data Formats

**Address Format Specification:**[3]
- First byte: `0x20`
- Remaining bytes: All zeros except token index
- Token index: Encoded in big-endian format
- Example: `0x200000000000000000000000000000000000abcd` where `abcd` is the token index

**Asset Bridge Structure:**[7]
- EVM Spot (ERC20) tokens linked to Core Spot (HIP-1) tokens
- Asset bridge precompile acts as lockbox for inter-layer transfers
- Consistent token identity across both execution environments

## 8. Integration Limitations and Considerations

### 8.1 Atomicity Constraints

While the integration provides significant advantages, developers must consider several limitations[8]:

**Partial Atomicity:**
- Event emission is atomic with EVM transactions
- L1 action execution occurs in the next L1 block, not atomically with EVM block
- No direct feedback mechanism for L1 action success/failure to EVM
- Actions may fail on L1 even if EVM transaction succeeds

**State Update Timing:**
- Updated L1 state from actions only available in subsequent EVM blocks
- Same-block state changes not reflected until next block cycle

### 8.2 Account Management Requirements

**L1 Account Existence:**[8]
- Smart contracts must have existing L1 accounts before first interaction
- New contracts require manual USDC transfer to create L1 account
- Silent failure occurs for non-existent L1 accounts

**Transaction Context:**[8]
- L1 actions execute in context of `msg.sender` (smart contract), not `tx.origin` (user)
- Requires careful design for fund and position management

### 8.3 Token Transfer Edge Cases

**Pre-crediting State:**[8]
- Token transfers via ERC20 to system address `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` enter pre-crediting state
- Balance not immediately reflected in same-block `balanceOf()` calls
- Protocols must track pre-credited amounts for accurate total balance calculations

## 9. Conclusion
