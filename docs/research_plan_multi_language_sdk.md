# Multi-Language SDK Generation Research Plan

## Task Overview
Research comprehensive multi-language SDK generation strategies and best practices for 2025, focusing on seven key areas:
1. Python with AsyncIO and Pydantic v2 patterns
2. TypeScript with full type safety and tree shaking
3. Rust with streaming primitives and zero-cost abstractions
4. Go with goroutines and built-in concurrency
5. Java with Project Loom virtual threads
6. Code generation tools, templates, and consistency patterns
7. Cross-language testing and conformance validation

## Research Plan
