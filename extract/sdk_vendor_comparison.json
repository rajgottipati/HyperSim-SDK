validates OpenAPI documents before generation; handles pagination patterns (offset, cursor, custom) natively; generates helper functions.", "Fern": "Supports OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1; limitations with sole OpenAPI reliance (pagination, OAuth, documentation, advanced type handling); sensitive to inconsistent patterns; may miss edge cases; supports standard pagination fields if clearly described in Fern Definition; Link pagination not supported; limited pagination customization (offset, results fields only).", "Stainless": "Partially supports OpenAPI Specification; best results with custom Stainless format; plain OpenAPI leads to missing features (pagination metadata, auth flows, webhook definitions); manual annotation needed for pagination from OpenAPI.", "OpenAPI Typescript Codegen": "Full support for OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0; interprets documents literally; incomplete/inaccurate SDK if document lacks examples, pagination metadata, or detailed schemas; no built-in understanding of pagination patterns or advanced spec features (oneOf, anyOf)."}, {"feature_name": "SDK Quality and Structure", "Speakeasy": "Production-ready by default; idiomatic for each target language; aligned with best practices; free of bloated/deeply nested structures; designed for immediate publishing to registries (npm, PyPI, Maven Central); sensible package structure, typed clients, minimal external dependencies.", "Fern": "Tend to be deeply nested and verbose; TypeScript code includes multiple layers of abstraction/utility wrappers; request logic often hidden; unclear separation between core logic and API-specific behavior; inconsistent naming; common operations span too many files; harder to read, debug, extend.", "Stainless": "Prioritizes clean SDKs with minimal dependencies and idiomatic formatting; SDK layout lacks structure (models, operations, helpers often mixed); error handling is thin, requiring manual retry logic, response decoding, fallback behavior.", "OpenAPI Typescript Codegen": "Clean but extremely basic; simple folder structure (/models, /services); low-level HTTP wrappers (Fetch, Axios); minimal/no error handling for API failures; feels closer to an API client scaffold than a complete platform."}, {"feature_name": "OAuth 2.0 Support", "Speakeasy": "Out of the box support; automatically detects OAuth 2.0 security scheme from OpenAPI; generates SDK code to manage tokens (fetching, expiration handling, refreshing); prompts for clientID/clientSecret; automatically fetches access token, retries requests with fresh token, adds Bearer Authorization header; custom token retrieval logic via SDK hooks.", "Fern": "Can generate SDKs supporting bearer token authentication (OAuth 2.0 access tokens); client setup expects token at initialization, automatically attaches to API calls; supports `client-credentials` and `authorization-code` flows; no support for advanced/legacy flows like `resource_owner_password`; no extensibility mechanism for custom auth flows.", "Stainless": "Does not manage OAuth tokens; developers must fetch access tokens manually and inject into client's headers; no built-in retry, refresh, or expiration handling.", "OpenAPI Typescript Codegen": "No built-in helpers for OAuth flows; manual handling of authentication, token management, and refresh logic outside the SDK required."}, {"feature_name": "Webhooks Support", "Speakeasy": "Automatic webhook event validation and parsing; generates functions to automatically verify webhook signatures and parse payload according to OpenAPI event schema.", "Fern": "Provides `constructEvent` helper to verify webhook signatures and parse payloads; requires manual configuration of secrets, mapping headers, and implementing error handling, replay protection, logging.", "Stainless": "Does not support webhooks; manual implementation of verification (HMAC, RSA) and deserialization logic needed; no helper or built-in type-safe handler.", "OpenAPI Typescript Codegen": "No native support for webhook validation, parsing, or handling; focuses on REST API clients."}, {"feature_name": "Streaming Support", "Speakeasy": "Supports streaming for download and upload endpoints; handles large files/long-lived responses; exposes response as a stream; enabled by defining endpoint with `application/octet-stream` content type and binary format in OpenAPI.", "Fern": "Supports binary uploads using `bytes` type in Fern Definition; expects `type: file` for responses to treat data as streamable file; streaming behavior only available when using Fern Definition; manual handling required for uploads/downloads with OpenAPI.", "Stainless": "Only available for Enterprise customers.", "OpenAPI Typescript Codegen": "Not natively supported; large uploads/downloads require manual adjustment of Fetch/Axios request configurations."}, {"feature_name": "Generated Documentation and Examples", "Speakeasy": "Automatically generates documentation in `README.md`, `RUNTIMES.md`, `FUNCTIONS.md`, `USAGE.md`; includes concise usage examples (resource creation, retries, auth) based on OpenAPI document; browsable documentation site in `docs` directory.", "Fern": "With Fern Definition, includes well-structured inline documentation and developer-friendly examples; with OpenAPI only, documentation is basic and lacks detailed examples; relies heavily on OpenAPI document information.", "Stainless": "Limited inline documentation from OpenAPI; quality improves with Stainless format;

flexibility comes with vendor lock-in; often requires managing two sources of truth (OpenAPI, Fern Definition); allows custom code augmentation after SDK generation.", "Stainless": "Only available when using Stainless format;
