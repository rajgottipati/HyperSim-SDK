{"extracted_information": "The Azure SDK team leverages AutoRest and the OpenAPI specification to generate much of the code for their multi-language SDKs. This approach ensures a consistent development experience across different programming languages. AutoRest's flexible pipeline allows language-specific code generators to produce code aligned with the design guidelines for each language. The generated code utilizes the corresponding Azure Core implementation for consistent configurable HTTP request behavior.\n\nFor data plane APIs, which have varied designs, the team uses AutoRest to generate the core functionality. A 'convenience layer' is then built on top, providing a more crafted design. These crafted interfaces are reviewed by an architecture board to ensure adherence to Azure SDK design guidelines and to maintain reasonable consistency between languages.", "specifications": {"OpenAPI_Versions_Supported_by_AutoRest_V3": "2.0 and 3.0", "AutoRest_Core_Mechanism": "Flexible pipeline transforming OpenAPI specs into a 'code model' consumed by language-specific code generators.", "AutoRest_V3_Modeler": "Modelerfour, which performs: duplicate schema definition reconciliation, application of OpenAPI extensions, inconsistency checks, pre-formatting of names (camel/Pascal casing), flattening of nested parameters/payload schemas."}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Code Generation via AutoRest", "description": "Automates the creation of client libraries from OpenAPI specifications, reducing manual effort and promoting consistency."}, {"name": "Multi-language Support", "description": "Supports C#, Python, Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, PowerShell, Go, and Swift, ensuring broad compatibility."}, {"name": "Azure Core Integration", "description": "Generated code uses Azure Core implementations for consistent and configurable HTTP request behavior across languages."}, {"name": "Design Guideline Adherence", "description": "Code generators align output with language-specific design guidelines.
