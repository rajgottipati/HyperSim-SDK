{"extracted_information": "The content introduces Java virtual threads with Project Loom, released in Java 21, as a significant advancement for high-concurrency applications. It contrasts virtual threads with the traditional thread-per-request model, highlighting their ability to manage thousands or millions of concurrent tasks with minimal resource impact. Virtual threads are described as lightweight, user-mode threads managed by the JVM, unlike platform threads mapped directly to OS threads, which enables higher concurrency without overwhelming system resources. A key benefit mentioned is 'Lightweight Concurrency', stating they require very little memory.", "specifications": {"java_version": "Java 21", "project_name": "Project Loom", "thread_type": "Virtual Threads", "management": "JVM-managed (user-mode)", "concurrency_scale": "Thousands (even millions) of threads", "resource_impact": "Minimal resource impact, very little memory"}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Lightweight Concurrency", "description": "Virtual threads require very little memory and minimal resource impact, allowing for high concurrency (thousands to millions of threads)."}, {"name": "JVM-managed", "description": "Unlike platform threads that map to OS threads, virtual threads are managed by the JVM, simplifying concurrency."}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"release_date_context": "Introduced with Java 21"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
