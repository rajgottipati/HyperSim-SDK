{"extracted_information": "HyperEVM utilizes a dual-block architecture where the mempool, an onchain state relative to the umbrella L1 execution, is split into two independent mempools. These two mempools source transactions for two distinct block types. These block types are interleaved, each assigned a unique and increasing sequence of EVM block numbers. For transaction processing, the onchain mempool implementation enforces a limit, accepting only the next 8 nonces per address. Additionally, transactions that remain in the mempool for longer than 1 day are automatically pruned.", "specifications": {"mempool_structure": "Split into two independent mempools", "nonce_acceptance_limit": "Next 8 nonces per address", "transaction_pruning_policy": "Transactions older than 1 day in mempool are pruned"}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Dual independent mempools", "Interleaved block types with unique increasing EVM block numbers", "Onchain mempool state for L1 execution", "Nonce-based transaction acceptance limit", "Age-based transaction pruning from mempool"], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"last_updated": "2 months ago", "transaction_pruning_timeframe": "1 day"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
