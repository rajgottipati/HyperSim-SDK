{"extracted_information": "The HyperEVM's 'mempool' functions as an onchain state, partitioned into two distinct, independent mempools. These two mempools are responsible for sourcing transactions for two separate block types. These block types are interleaved, maintaining a unique and increasing sequence of EVM block numbers. The onchain mempool implementation specifically accepts only the next 8 nonces per address, and transactions exceeding 1 day old are pruned from the mempool.", "specifications": {"mempool_nonce_limit": "8 nonces per address", "mempool_pruning_rule": "transactions older than 1 day old are pruned"}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["HyperEVM mempool split into two independent mempools", "Two block types are interleaved", "Unique increasing sequence of EVM block numbers", "Onchain mempool accepts next 8 nonces per address", "Transactions older than 1 day are pruned from mempool"], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"last_updated": "2 months ago"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
