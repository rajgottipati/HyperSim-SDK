{"extracted_information": "The Circuit Breaker pattern is a resilience pattern that helps applications handle faults from remote services or resources. It temporarily blocks access to a faulty service after detecting failures, preventing repeated unsuccessful attempts and allowing system recovery. It improves stability and resiliency by acting as a proxy that monitors failure counts and decides whether to allow an operation to proceed or return an exception immediately. The pattern is implemented as a state machine with Closed, Open, and Half-Open states, with specific rules for transitions, counters, and timers.", "specifications": {"circuit_breaker_states": {"Closed": {"description": "The default operational state.

Quickly recognizes and handles failed operations. Prevents cascading failures by avoiding resource exhaustion (e.g., memory, threads) from blocked requests.
