{"extracted_information": "The web content provides an essential guide to Asyncio in Python for 2025, focusing on its core concepts, common patterns, and best practices. Asyncio is presented as a solution for non-blocking I/O operations (e.g., web scraping, network services, chat apps) to optimize CPU usage by allowing concurrent execution within a single thread. It leverages lightweight coroutines, is built into the standard library, and offers a transparent `async`/`await` syntax.
