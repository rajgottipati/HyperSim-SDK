A large number of dependencies can make it difficult to use the SDK with other libraries and frameworks, potentially leading to abandonment due to incompatible dependency resolution issues.

These are crucial for production use cases, speeding up integrations by providing sensible defaults and reducing the user's need to implement them."}, {"name": "Language Idiomatic Design", "description": "SDKs should conform to the conventions and expectations of each specific programming language. Examples for a Go SDK include: minimal dependencies (relying on standard library), struct tags and reflection for (de)serialization based on OpenAPI, use of pointers for optional objects (to differentiate unset vs. zero values), and a 'Utils' package to bundle configuration/serialization methods and avoid duplication."}, {"name": "Sustainable SDK Development (Modern Architecture Patterns)", "description": "Addresses the challenges of supporting a long tail of languages/runtimes and preventing SDK drift. Recommends using SDK generators and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines. This automates SDK updates whenever the API changes, ensuring continuous parity between SDKs and the API, preventing manual refactoring burden and divergent behavior. Speakeasy generator is mentioned as a solution for this."}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"publication_date": "March 21, 2024", "read_time": "9 min", "last_updated": "July 14, 2025"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": ["https://www.postman.com/explore/most-popular-apis-this-year", "https://octoverse.github.com/2022/top-programming-languages"]}
