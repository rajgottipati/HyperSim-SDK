{"extracted_information": "The article 'Mastering OpenAPI Types: Best Practices for Data Types and Formats' provides comprehensive guidance on designing precise OpenAPI specifications for improved SDK generation. Key practices include explicit type definitions, rigorous validation, and planning for tooling compatibility. It details best practices for various OpenAPI data types (String, Number & Integer, Boolean, Array, Object, Null), their specific formats, validation attributes, and how these choices impact downstream processes like code generation and documentation. The core message emphasizes that clear, explicit API definitions lead to robust code generation and better tooling integration.", "specifications": {"data_types_and_formats": {"string": {"description": "Workhorse type for text and complex data.", "formats": ["date (RFC3339 dates, e.g., '2025-03-07')", "date-time (full timestamps, e.g., '2025-03-07T15:26:38Z')", "password (hint for sensitive data)", "byte (Base64 encoded data)", "binary (raw binary data)", "email (unofficial but common)", "uuid (unofficial but common)", "uri (unofficial but common)", "hostname (unofficial but common)", "ipv4/ipv6 (unofficial but common)"], "patterns": "Use regex patterns to constrain content (e.g., '^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$')", "best_practice": "Always validate input; well-defined strings improve documentation and make client-side parsing/generation predictable."}, "number_and_integer": {"description": "Distinguishes between generic numbers and integers.", "number_formats": ["float (32-bit floating point)", "double (64-bit floating point)"], "integer_formats": ["int32 (32-bit integer)", "int64 (64-bit integer)"], "validation_attributes": ["minimum", "maximum", "exclusiveMinimum", "exclusiveMaximum", "multipleOf"], "tip": "Explicitly specifying the format avoids ambiguity in various languages."}, "boolean": {"description": "Accepts only 'true' or 'false'.", "restriction": "Does not accept '1' or '0'.", "best_practice": "Stick to true booleans for consistent behavior across all consumers."}, "array": {"description": "Defines ordered lists of items.", "items_attribute": "Used to specify the type of elements in the array.", "validation_attributes": ["minItems", "maxItems", "uniqueItems"], "best_practice": "Utilize array-level validations to enforce data integrity before business logic."}, "object": {"description": "Can be fully typed, serve as dictionaries, or be free-form.", "fully_typed_object": "Define explicit properties with validations and required fields.", "dictionary_with_additionalProperties": "Used for flexible key/value pairs where keys are always strings (e.g., 'additionalProperties: type: string').", "best_practice": "Define all properties explicitly when possible.
