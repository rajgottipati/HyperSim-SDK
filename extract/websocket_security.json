It involves the client obtaining a server-generated authorization 'ticket' from the HTTP server, which contains user/account ID, client IP, and timestamp.

This ticket is then used as part of the initial WebSocket handshake. The server validates the ticket by checking its integrity, verifying the client's IP, ensuring it hasn't been re-used, and confirming it hasn't expired. This provides a secure, explicit authentication layer for WebSocket connections, independent of shared HTTP headers."}], "security_best_practices": [{"practice": "Validate Client Input", "description": "Assume that all data coming from a client is arbitrary.
