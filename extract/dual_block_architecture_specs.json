{"extracted_information": "The HyperEVM dual-block architecture features a mempool that is an onchain state relative to the umbrella L1 execution. This mempool is divided into two independent mempools, each sourcing transactions for one of the two block types. These block types are interleaved with a unique, increasing sequence of EVM block numbers. The onchain mempool implementation enforces a limit of accepting only the next 8 nonces per address, and transactions older than 1 day within the mempool are automatically pruned.", "specifications": {"architecture_type": "Dual-block architecture", "mempool_status": "Onchain state with respect to umbrella L1 execution", "block_numbering": "Interleaved with unique increasing sequence of EVM block numbers"}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Mempool structure", "description": "Split into two independent mempools that source transactions for the two block types"}, {"name": "Nonce acceptance limit", "description": "Onchain mempool accepts only the next 8 nonces for each address"}, {"name": "Transaction pruning", "description": "Transactions older than 1 day old in the mempool are pruned"}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"last_updated": "2 months ago"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
