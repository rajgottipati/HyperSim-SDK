{"extracted_information": "The Hyperliquid.Orders module, part of the `hyperliquid v0.1.6` Elixir SDK, offers helper methods for order creation and management on Hyperliquid's perpetual and spot markets. It provides functions for retrieving mid-prices, creating market and limit orders, handling various order types (GTC, IOC, ALO), and managing position closures. Key features include mid-price retrieval with caching, slippage price calculation for market orders, and support for flexible order parameters like size, price, and slippage. The module interacts with the Hyperliquid API and cache for efficient processing.
