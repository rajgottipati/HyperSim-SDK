{"extracted_information": "The provided content is a GitHub file listing and commit history for the Hyperliquid Python SDK. It offers limited specific details on the SDK's comprehensive feature set, API endpoints covered, architecture, or limitations. Information primarily relates to recent code changes and the development process concerning code quality. The architecture and limitations of the SDK are not detailed in this content.\n\nDevelopment Approach (Code Quality/Linting):\n- Linting and formatting tasks are managed by `pre-commit` through various hooks.\n- `pre-commit` hook management reduces development dependencies in `pyproject.toml` to `mypy`, `pytest`, `pre-commit`, and `safety`.\n- `darglint` has been removed due to deprecation/discontinuation.\n- Development dependencies are updated, and `poetry.lock` is regenerated.\n- A workflow is implemented to run `pre-commit` for Pull Requests (PRs).\n- Makefile targets for linting/formatting are consolidated into a single `make pre-commit` command.", "specifications": {"development_dependencies": ["mypy", "pytest", "pre-commit", "safety"], "removed_development_tools": ["darglint"]}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "User Fills by Time Aggregation", "description": "Adds an `aggregateByTime` parameter to the `user_fills_by_time` method, enhancing data retrieval capabilities.", "api_endpoint_reference": "user_fills_by_time"}, {"name": "No-Op Action Support", "description": "Includes support for a `noop` action, indicating a minimal or null operation capability within the SDK.", "api_endpoint_reference": "noop_action (implicit)"}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"versions_mentioned": [{"version": "0.18.0", "commit_date": "Aug 12, 2025"}, {"version": "0.12.0", "commit_date": "Apr 22, 2025"}, {"version": "0.1.6", "commit_date": "Mar 30, 2023"}], "commit_history_highlights": [{"summary": "Refactor linting + enable via Github workflow", "date": "Feb 6, 2025"}, {"summary": "Remove deprecated example", "date": "Aug 5, 2025"}, {"summary": "added aggregateByTime param into the user_fills_by_time method", "date": "Aug 15, 2025"}, {"summary": "Various small updates", "date": "Jan 9, 2025"}, {"summary": "Add evm block indexer example", "date": "Feb 14, 2025"}]}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
