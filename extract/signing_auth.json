{"extracted_information": "The document primarily advises on signature generation, recommending the use of existing SDKs to prevent errors. Incorrect signatures lead to specific L1 errors (\"User or API Wallet ... does not exist.\" or \"Must deposit before performing actions.\"), indicating that the recovered signer address does not match the intended wallet. Debugging incorrect signatures is challenging as the error message is unspecific; it's recommended to review the Python SDK and add logging.
