{"extracted_information": "Detailed information about Hyperliquid exchange endpoints, order placement, and various transaction handling operations. The exchange endpoint facilitates interaction and trading on the Hyperliquid chain. Order placement includes standard and TWAP orders, with specified request body parameters. Transaction handling covers order cancellations, fund transfers (USDC, spot, inter-account), staking operations, vault interactions, API/builder fee approvals, withdrawals, and a 'dead man's switch' for scheduled order cancellation. A testnet-only asset sending function is also available, demonstrating signature generation for transactions.", "specifications": {"exchange_endpoint_purpose": "Interact with and trade on the Hyperliquid chain", "signature_generation": "Utilizes Python SDK", "asset_identification": {"perpetuals": "Index in the `universe` field returned by the `meta` response", "spot_assets": "`10000 + index` where `index` is the corresponding index in `spotMeta.universe`", "example_spot_asset_purr_usdc": "asset `10000` (index 0)"}, "place_order_request_body_keys": {"a": "asset", "b": "isBuy (boolean)", "p": "price", "s": "size", "r": "reduceOnly (boolean)", "t": "type (order type)", "c": "cloid (client order id)"}, "place_order_optional_builder_argument_keys": {"b": "address to receive the additional fee", "f": "size of the fee in tenths of a basis point (e.g., 10 for 1bp)"}, "sign_typed_data_example_hyperliquidtransaction_spotsend": {"types": {"HyperliquidTransaction:SpotSend": [{"name": "hyperliquidChain", "type": "string"}, {"name": "destination", "type": "string"}, {"name": "token", "type": "string"}, {"name": "amount", "type": "string"}, {"name": "time", "type": "uint64"}]}, "primaryType": "HyperliquidTransaction:SpotSend", "domain": {"name": "HyperliquidSignTransaction", "version": "1", "chainId": 42161, "verifyingContract": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"}, "message": {"destination": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "token": "PURR:0xc1fb593aeffbeb02f85e0308e9956a90", "amount": "0.1", "time": 1716531066415, "hyperliquidChain": "Mainnet"}}}, "pricing": {}, "features": [{"name": "Place an order", "description": "Submits a new order to the exchange with specified parameters for asset, buy/sell side, price, size, reduce-only status, type, and client order ID.
